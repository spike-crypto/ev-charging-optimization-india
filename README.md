EV Charging Station Optimization in Indian Metropolitan Cities.

## 📌 Overview
This project explores **EV charging demand and pricing optimization** in **Indian metropolitan cities**.  
We analyze **charging trends** based on **office break hours and evening usage**, compare **fast vs. slow chargers**, and build a **prediction model** for pricing.

## 📊 Key Insights
✔ **Peak Usage Hours**: High demand during **office breaks (12-2 PM) & evenings (6-9 PM)**  
✔ **Fast vs. Slow Chargers**: Users prefer **fast chargers** despite higher pricing.  
✔ **Pricing Trends**: Certain cities have **higher charging efficiency**, affecting pricing.
